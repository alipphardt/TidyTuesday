# TidyTuesday

Join the R4DS Online Learning Community in the weekly [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) event!

Every week we post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask you to explore the data.

While the dataset will be “tamed”, it will not always be tidy! As such you might need to apply various R for Data Science techniques to wrangle the data into a true tidy format.

The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater #RStats community!

As such we encourage everyone of all skills to participate!

# Loading the Weekly Dataset

Download the weekly data and make it available in the `drought` object.

[U.S. Droughts](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-20/readme.md)

```{r Load}

# Loading Data for the First Time
# tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 30)
# drought <- tuesdata$drought
# write_csv(drought, 'drought.csv')

drought <- read_csv('drought.csv')

```


# Sample Data

Take an initial look at the format of the data available.

```{r Glimpse}

glimpse(drought)


```

# Wrangling and Exploration


Counts for categorical variables. There appears to be observations for all states, plus DC and Puerto Rico.

```{r categorical_counts}

categorical_count = function(tbl, column){
  tbl %>% count({{column}}, sort = TRUE)
}

print.data.frame(categorical_count(drought, state_abb))
categorical_count(drought, stat_fmt)
categorical_count(drought, drought_lvl)


```

Let's check for missing values in numerical columns. It looks like only **area_total** and **pop_total** have missing values. Missing values only seem to occur for observations where a state was in extreme or exceptional drought. There doesnt seem to be any pattern with which there are missing values in those columns

```{r missing}

summary(drought %>% select(where(is.numeric)))

drought %>%
  filter(is.na(area_total) | is.na(pop_total)) %>%
  select(-map_date, -stat_fmt) %>%
  count(drought_lvl)

drought %>% count(drought_lvl)

drought %>%
  select(area_total, pop_total) %>%
  filter(area_total == 0 | pop_total == 0)


```

Which states were most frequently in a period of extreme drought?

```{r extreme}

drought %>% 
  filter(drought_lvl %in% c("D3", "D4"), area_total > 0) %>%
  count(state_abb, sort = TRUE)

drought %>% 
  filter(state_abb == "CA", drought_lvl %in% c("D3", "D4")) %>%
  mutate(pop_total = case_when(
    is.na(pop_total) ~ 0,
    TRUE ~ pop_total
  ),
  drought_lvl = recode(drought_lvl, D3 = "Severe", D4 = "Extreme"),
  drought_lvl = fct_rev(drought_lvl)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=valid_start, y = pop_total/1000000)) +
  geom_area(aes(fill = drought_lvl)) +
  labs(title = "Millions affected by severe or extreme drought in California",
       y = "",
       x = "",
       fill = "Drought Level")

```


# Visualization

Using a heatmap to show extended periods of severe drought in the U.S.

```{r heatmap}

    TRUE ~ pop_total
  ),
